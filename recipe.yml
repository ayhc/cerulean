# These scripts will be executed during the container build.
# Place scripts in the "scripts/" dir and put the corresponding filenames here.
# Any files that aren't listed here won't be executed automatically, which
# means that you can place "helper" or "library" scripts in the folder too.
# You can use "autorun.sh" if you want an automatic runner.
scripts:
  # "Pre" scripts run very early in the build, immediately after your custom
  # repos have been imported (so that you can access those repos if necessary).
  pre:
    # Automatically runs script files within "scripts/pre/".
    - autorun.sh
    # Manually listed scripts.
    # - example_pre.sh

  # "Post" scripts run at the end of the build process.
  post:
    # Automatically runs script files within "scripts/post/".
    - autorun.sh
    # Manually listed scripts.
    # - example_post.sh

# Custom RPM configuration.
# These changes will be integrated into your custom image at the "system level".
rpm:
  # A list of urls of ".repo" files that should be added to your system.
  # This is the proper way to add custom COPR repos to your image.
  # Tip: Use `%FEDORA_VERSION%` instead of static Fedora version numbers,
  # so that your repos automatically use your image's actual Fedora version,
  # which greatly simplifies future maintenance of your custom recipe.
  repos:
    # Example (which also demonstrates version number expansion):
    # - https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/starship/repo/fedora-%FEDORA_VERSION%/atim-starship-fedora-%FEDORA_VERSION%.repo

  # These RPMs will be installed from your enabled repositories (Fedora's own
  # repos, extra "repos" you've added, etc). The installation is automatically
  # performed via rpm-ostree during the image build, and will be pre-installed
  # at the "system level" in the final image.
  install:
    # Needed for yafti (the first boot installer). Remove if you're not using yafti.

    # GNOME's GTK4 theme, Libadwaita. Already included in Silverblue, but not
    # other spins. You can remove if you aren't using yafti, but many native
